# Sydenhams navigation

##Deployment

Unzip the file and open index.html. To test the search facility, type 'hig', 'clo' or 'pow'. The search facility is only set up for desktop, not mobile.

##Detail

For the desktop mega menu, I purely used CSS - on the reasoning that simpler is always better.

The clickable dropdown menu on the mobile version utilises JavaScript - no JQuery has been used.

The search facility code was taken from [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp ](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp). 

I had to map the objects into an array that the function could handle, and then change how the function displayed the data.

One of the image addresses appeared to have an error so I have used a default image for errors.

If I came back to this, I would use some extra script to clear all the mobile styles when switching back to desktop size. It would make the CSS slightly less confusing.
